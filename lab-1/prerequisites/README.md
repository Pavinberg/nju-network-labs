# Task 1: Prerequisites

There are three things you need to know. The operating system we use is Linux. The program language we use is Python. And the distributed version control system we use is Git. We list some helpful materials below.

* [Linux](linux.md)
* [Python](python.md)
* [Git](git.md)

In further experiments, we assume that you **have mastered** the use of these tools.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that we use Mininet in our experiment which will be introduced in Task 2. Mininet requires Linux **ONLY** because it uses _process-based virtualization_ which means that it cannot be run on macOS and Windows for now. As a result, you must have a Linux platform for our experiment.
