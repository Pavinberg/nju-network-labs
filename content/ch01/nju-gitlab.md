# Task 3: NJU GitLab

To submit your work, you need to do the following things at the first time:

1. Sign up on https://git.nju.edu.cn with your own NJU email account.

2. Sign in.

3. Import the repository https://git.nju.edu.cn/njucn-2020-spring/switchyard to your own account and make it private, then you will get your own repository url. Here is a brief guide in one picture about how to import the project. **Don't fork** because that makes your repository public.

4. Share your repository with us.

   1. Find "Members" in "Settings" of your repository.

   2. In "Invite group", select `njucn-2020-spring/student/<学号>` and make us as "Reporter" or "Developer".

	{% hint style="info" %}
	Please fill out the form in the QQ group file *GitLab 私有仓库地址提交* first. After we collect them, we will inform you of the invitation.
	{% endhint %}
   

5. There is a directory `~/switchyard` in your virtual machine (if you use the VM image we provide). Set the remote repository of `switchyard` to your repository url by running the command `git remote set-url origin <your repository url>`. Otherwise, clone your own remote repository.
