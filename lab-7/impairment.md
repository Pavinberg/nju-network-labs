# Task 4: Implement some other type of network impairment

## Details

Rules that permit traffic may specify that the traffic flow should be impaired in some way. A rule that specifies that traffic should be impaired should simply have the keyword impair as the last item in a rule. For example:

```text
# allow, but degrade the service given to packets
# from source 10.0.0.1 destined to any host in
# 192.168.0.0/16.  
permit ip src 10.0.0.1 dst 192.168.0.0/16 impair
```

You can choose exactly how flows should be impaired. Here are some fun options:

* Randomly drop some fraction of the packets belonging to the flow.
* Rewrite/overwrite the TCP advertised window to make it smaller.
* Rewrite/overwrite the application payload contents of packets.
* Randomly inject TCP RST packets to reset \(and take down\) traffic

  flows.

Lastly, note that a given permit rule may specify a rate limit, that impairment should be applied, or that the traffic should simply be permitted. A rule may not specify both a rate limit and impairment.

## Coding

Your task is to implement the logic described above. The start file is named `lab_7/firewall.py`.
